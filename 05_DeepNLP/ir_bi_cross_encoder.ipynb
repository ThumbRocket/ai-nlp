Mc Ewen Author of Married to the Brand Yet another comprehensive study of auto buyers ignores the enormous impact of consumer emotions A recent study of automobile buyers has concluded that there are only two critical factors that influence car-buying decisions in the United States: \"product excellence\" and \"cost of ownership.\" According to the Booz Allen consultancy, which conducted the study, these two factors account for about 90% of the perceived differences among alternative vehicle brands. The study, which was the result of an intensive investigation into a decade of automobile buyer data, seems to have crystal clear implications for auto marketers and their ad agencies. As one Booz Allen vice president states, \"If the pictures people are seeing don't show the functional attributes of the vehicle, you're wasting your money.\" Lifestyle and \"feel-good\" advertising, he further contends, fall flat because they completely ignore the real reasons people buy. This seems to make perfect sense. People buy cars for functional reasons, so they need products that perform. They use these products to commute to the office, pick up groceries, schlep the kids to soccer practice, and tow the family outboard to the lake on Friday. What they want -- and need -- to know is how the car will hold up and what sort of long-term return they can expect to get for their large investment. In large-scale studies such as this one, abundant data show that functional attributes are enormously important to consumers. The conclusion is, when it comes to spending thousands of dollars, people are logical. Aren't they? Maybe now we know the real reasons why SUVs are so popular: People apparently love to go off-roading -- and they obviously need that 4-wheel-drive capability -- on the way to get groceries in Los Angeles and Miami. And we also know why middle-aged urban males buy sports cars -- they're just perfect for an urban commute on a gridlocked interstate. And, of course, they always buy the better rated, higher resale value option. Or, could it simply be that when people are asked for the \"reasons why\" they buy things -- including cars -- they'll usually offer up logical reasons, mainly because they believe it's important to appear logical? Ferrari and Hummer owners can, and will, talk about their vehicle's resale value and its impressive performance features. But they buy these cars because of how owning these brands makes them feel. Let us \"reason\" together Lots of studies report the \"reasons\" people give for the purchases they make, then correlate consumers' ratings of various product features with their reported intentions or purchases. In many of these studies, buyers appear to be quite rational. As in the Booz Allen report, they appear to make decisions based on product quality and costs. But perhaps consumer decisions only appear \"rational\" because of the way many companies measure these decisions -- and what they include in that measurement. If there's a factor that companies haven't been able to measure, or measure adequately, then it's no surprise that it's overlooked in their analysis. However, these other factors do exist, and they do have an impact, in spite of the fact that many researchers fail to measure them. In his book How Consumers Think, Jerry Zaltman points out the fallacy of assuming that consumers make linear, logical choices simply because when asked about their decisions, buyers typically describe them that way. Do functional attributes count? Of course they do. But Gallup Organization research has revealed that the strength of the connection between a customer and a brand has an essential -- and reliably measurable -- emotional component. (See \"Getting Emotional About Brands,\" \"The Engagement Imperative,\" and \"The Constant Customer\" in See Also. )In case after case, Gallup has found that brand relationships are not simply rationally driven or logically grounded. They are also emotional. We have found that the strongest -- and certainly the most profitable -- auto buyer relationships are marked not just by confidence in vehicle performance, but also by real passion for the brand. Moving metal or building relationships? In a study of 904 recent (past-four-year) auto purchasers, Gallup researchers found that customers' perceptions of the durability of their vehicles was the number-one factor in building customer confidence and the number-two factor in building passion for their cars. (See sidebar: \"Levels of Customer Engagement. \")But vehicle quality, we found, does not account for 90% of the brand relationship. Beyond product attributes, there are other crucial factors that reflect the entire ownership experience, and these must be taken into account. For example, customers who stated that their auto dealer sales and service reps were \"extremely helpful\" were, on average, 11 times more likely to have passion for their cars. And in another study, we found that owners of Toyotas and Hondas, both of which are highly rated for their vehicle quality, were 10 to 15 times more disposed to repurchase those vehicle brands if they felt that their dealers provided outstanding customer service. Brand passion depends on more than just functional attributes. Gallup has found that emotional connections play a vital role in auto buyers' brand relationships. That doesn't mean obscure or obtuse \"image\" advertising campaigns, such as the much-bashed \"rocks and trees\" introductory Infiniti campaign, are the best approach to the brand-building challenge. But it also doesn't mean that \"rational\" product attribute displays should necessarily be the focus of every brand's advertising message. Vague and toothless brand promises, whether they are presented through image ads or hard sell feature-focused ads, won't build strong brand relationships. In fact, although advertising is the tool that marketers reach for most often when they want to establish and reinforce emotional connections with customers, it's seldom their most powerful one. Indeed, Gallup has found that advertising pales next to what happens at the dealership. Emotions are powerful brand differentiators, and they demonstrably affect consumer decisions, regardless of whether they're being recognized and addressed. Auto manufacturers who want to build strong emotional ties with consumers must do more than merely focus on functional attributes and strive for the reduction of vehicle defects. Customers aren't just \"touched\" by the quality and price of the vehicle or by the informational content of its advertising. Their perceptions are formed -- and their emotions are engaged -- by their experiences while their car is in the service bay, the treatment they receive during the financing process, the appreciative stares of their neighbors, and the time they spend on hold waiting to talk to a customer service representative. Those are the moments that enhance or endanger brand relationships. Keith Crain said it quite well in an Automotive News editorial a few years ago: \"Reliability, real value for your price, real quality without any exceptions. Those are just the price of admission . . . But in the end, you must have something that creates passion in the mind of the buyer. \"We agree. With apologies to Ford, quality may be job one, but it clearly isn't the only one. William J. Mc Ewen, Ph. D., is the author of Married to the Brand.

Road network Most roads are good, but there are a lot of single track roads in the Highlands, very narrow roads. Fuel prices For actual fuel prices in all European countries see Autotraveler.ru. Code licence plate UKTelephone countrycode 44Internet countrycode .uk Time difference GMT; 1 hour earlier than in the Netherlands Geographic data Scotland is part of the United Kingdom (officially: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), but most people call it just England which is not really true. The last countings tell there are about 5.2 million inhabitants at this moment, an average population density of 66 people per square kilometer (the average in the whole UK is 381 p. sq. km.). But the number of people is declining and the expectation is there will be no more than 5 million people in 2026. Scotland makes up for almost 35% of the surface of the UK (78.722 sq. km. ), but only 9.5% of the population lives there. Scotland and it's offshore islands are the northern part of the British island. On the west and north coast the Atlantic forms the border and in the east coast the Northsea. In the south the border with England goes over the Cheviott Hills, for 90 kilometers. The biggest distance from north to south on the Scottish mainland (Cape Wrath - Mull of Kintyre) is 441 km. and from east to west (Applecross-Peterhead) 248 km. The west coast is, in a straight line, 416 km. long, but in reality (because of the many bays) 3200 km. Scotland counts 790 islands, of which 130 are inhabited. Geografically Scotland consists of 2 parts: the mainland and the islands. On the mainland, one can discern 3 clear landmasses: the northen Highlands, the central Highlands and the Lowlands. The Highlands are divded by the Great Glen, a narrow gap in the mountain landscape. For a matter of fact, the glens are very characteristic to the whole country. They are valleys, made by glaciers with steep walls and often with elongated lakes (lochs). The highest top in this area (and of the whole of the UK) is Ben Nevis (1344 meters), near Fort William. Population The population distinguishes itself from the English through it's own language and literature, jurisdiction, education and organisation of the church. The Scots have a strong historical consciousness. The greater part of the population springs from the original Scottish population, which in fact is a jumble of Picts, Celts and Normans. Contrary to the rest of the UK, less people live in the cities and more in the countryside. With a population density of 66 people per square kilometer it is fairly quiet. Yet the distribution is very uneven: more than 1.5 of the 5 million inhabitants lives in one of the 4 big cities: Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. Our experiences have shown us that the people are very friendly and helpful, but they seem to have an inferiority complex in relation to the English; they still feel being dominated by them. It is almost, after centuries of British rule, as if it is genetically determined. Languages English is the official language of Scotland, but one can clearly discern a Scottish kind of english, a dialect. In the Highlands there are still people who speak Gaelic. Gaelic springs from the various (6) Celtic languages of the past and nowadays 3 forms have survived: Irish Gaelic (Gaeilge), Manx Gaelic (Gailck) and Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig). These 3 languages are being spoken in Ireland, on the island Man and in Scotland. The speakers of these languages are called Gaels (formerly Celts). About 60.000 people in Scotland still speak it, so not more than 1% of the total population! A few centuries ago there were 3 more languages besides English: Pictic, Gaelic and Norwegian. In the present Scottish language many words pop up from these 3 languages. Climate Scotland lies on the edge of the European continent and is surrounded by water on 3 sides. It has a moderate seaclimate with soft winters and cool summers. A belt of westward winds continuously sends a dense layer of clouds over the land. The west coast is generally wetter than the east but less windy. On the east coast the rainfall averages 650mm and on the west coast it averages 1500mm. Average summer highs are about 19 degrees and winter temperatures rarely drop below 0 degrees. Generally, there is snow in the higher areas from December until March. For the most sunshine and a minimum of rain, one has to go there in May or June. July and August are hotter, but also more wet and there are countless midgets. The autumn really can be called unstable: sometimes beuatiful and dry, sometimes wet, but quiet, sometimes very stormy. From experience we know that for the last few years the weather is very unpredictable and different than it used to be: too much rain and low temperatures. We never went for the weather, but seem to have been quite lucky: most days were dry and on almost every day we saw at least a bit of sunshine. In Scotland, the weather can show every season in a single day! Even on the sunniest of days care needs to be taken on the hills and mountains. On a mountain, within only 5 minutes, a mist can envelope a walker and make navigation difficult. On the other hand, brooding clouds can ease to spectacular shafts of bright sunlight. Flora and fauna The Highlands are barren and unhospitable. The landscape consists of infertile plains without trees. The vegetation includes heather, fern, a variety of grasses, Juneper berry and similar small bushes. Some 4.000 years ago, there were mainly pine trees (Scots pine), but deforestation, intensive grazing by sheep and changes in climate, have replaced the once extensive woods with a thick layer of peat. Reforesting has begun, but the new woods are quite one-sided and monotonous. There is a great variety of birds, near the coast more than in the inetrior. On the islands and on the steep cliffs of the mainland, many seabirds nest, like ospreys, auks, terns and gannets. In the mountain areas there are golden eagles and ravens, on the moors snow hen and pheasants and owls and sangbirds in the woods. The largest mammal on land is the deer, which causes a lot of damage to new plantations and nests of rare birds. Big mammals, like the wolf, beaver, beer and elk are extinct already in the 18th century. The sheep, the Scottish Highlanders, and also the Shetland pony's, which all walk about freely, are half wild. Economy For centuries, the economical development of Scotland lagged behind that of England, it's location being one reason. This results in emigration from many people from this area to make money somewhere else. Edinburgh is the financial center of the country. There, also the Bank of Scotland is established (where they make their own Scottish bank notes). Tourism still is important to the economy of the country, although, for various reasons, it is less than it used to be. Almost 80% of the Scottish soil is used for agricultural purposes. In the South and Middle Scotland there are vast farming areas, where cattle breeding is the main activity. Nevertheless, The mouth and foot disease disaster in 2001 hurt Scotland, economically, more in tourism than in the agrarian sector. The fishing industry is important along all of the coast (haddock, codfish, herring, crustaceans). The breeding of salmon also appears. Most important places with a fishing industry are: Aberdeen, Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Kinlochbervie, Lerwick and Ullapool. Among the minerals, which Scotland possesses, are coal (in Lothian, Fife and Ayr) and iron ore (in het south west, Strathclyde). But, like in other parts of the UK, mining industry is declining. The mining of oil and gas from the Northsea is also of importance to Scotland's economy. True Scottish export articles are whisky (mostly to the United States), woolen fabrics (tweed) and foods. Most important buyers are England and the countries of the Commonwealth. Scotland has a good road and railway network. There are four international airports: Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Prestwick, and several smaller airports, used for local traffic. Tourism Tourism is very important to the economy of Scotland, but it has suffered a lot from cattle ailments the last few years, like the foot and mouth disease and the mad cow disease. And after the attacks on September 11th 2001, the American tourists stayed away. This, of course, applies for the whole of Europe and the British government has taken all sorts of measures to increase the numbers of tourists again, but as yet Scottish tourism is doing badly. But we couldn't find accurate data on this. The Scottish-English conflict The Scots are very proud of their country, nationalistic even; this is proven by their history and we noticed it ourselves also. Since 1999, July the first, Scotland has its own Parliament in Edinburgh, after 292 years. It has very limited powers and responsibilities, with major policy (taxation, economy, transport, defence, foreign policy, broadcasting) still decided by Westminster - but it is a Parliament nonetheless. There are 129 members of Scottish Parliament who can decide on other matters, under the direction of the first minister. Many Scots still feel the dependancy to the UK (and England) is too great and think they are being put at a disadvantage compared to the other parts of the kingdom. There have been studies about the division of financial support, which proved that Scotland got it's share and maybe even more. The majority of the people want self-government to a larger extent, but are not striving for total independance. Yet there are political movements whose aims are self-rule and independance. The Scottisch National Party is a party which claims to look after the interests of the Scottish people. The party was founded in 1934, when circumstances of life were miserable for the workers and Scotland was neglected by the UK. A website from the movement Siol nan Gaidheal about the independance of Scotland can be found here.

[1] It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence against peacetime targets or in war against non-combatants. [2] The terms \"terrorist\" and \"terrorism\" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century [3] but gained mainstream popularity during the U. S. Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–89) after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings [4] and again after the attacks on New York City and Washington, D. C. in September 2001 [5] [4] [6] and on Bali in October 2002. [4]There is no commonly accepted definition of \"terrorism\". [7] [8] Being a charged term, with the connotation of something \"morally wrong\", it is often used, both by governments and non-state groups, to abuse or denounce opposing groups. [9] [10] [4] [11] [8] Broad categories of political organisations have been claimed to have been involved in terrorism to further their objectives, including right-wing and left-wing political organisations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. [12] Terrorism-related legislation has been adopted in various states, regarding \"terrorism\" as a crime. [13] [14] There is no universal agreement as to whether or not \"terrorism\", in some definition, should be regarded as a war crime. [14] [15]According to the Global Terrorism Database by the University of Maryland, College Park, more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, have been recorded from 2000 to 2014.

General Napoléon Bonaparte quelling the 5 October 1795 royalist rebellion in Paris, in front of the Église Saint-Roch, Saint-Honoré Street, paving the way for Directory government. The Latin verb terrere means: to frighten. [17] The English word 'terror', just like the French terreur, derives from that Latin word and means from of old: fright, alarm, anguish, (mortal) fear, panic. Oxford English Dictionary reportedly states that the word 'terrorist' (French: terroriste) was invented in the year 1794, during the French Revolution. The first meaning of the word 'terrorist' was then: adherent or supporter of the Jacobins. [18] Apparent from the context given in an article in the Guardian, the indication 'Jacobins' in that Oxford definition bears on the group around Maximilien Robespierre, also called 'Montagnards', that after 1794 were held responsible by some commentators for the repressive and violent government over France between June 1793 and July 1794, a period analogously labeled ' Reign of Terror ' by commentators. [18] The given definition in Oxford Dictionary shows, the term 'terrorist' in its first use was meant as abusive term for someone's political or historical ideas or allegiances, not as description of his personal actions. [18]In December 1795, Edmund Burke used the word \"Terrorists\" in a description of the new French government called 'Directory': \"At length, after a terrible struggle, the [Directory] Troops prevailed over the Citizens (…) To secure them further, they have a strong corps of irregulars, ready armed. Thousands of those Hell-hounds called Terrorists, whom they had shut up in Prison on their last Revolution, as the Satellites of Tyranny, are let loose on the people.\" [19] Clearly, in this case, Burke used 'Terrorists' as disparaging labeling of armed troops hired by a government he loathes. French historian Sophie Wahnich (French) distinguishes between the revolutionary terror of the French Revolution and the terrorists of the September 11 attacks: Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense . . . The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States.

(March 2017)Attack at the Bologna railway station on 2 August 1980 by the neo-fascist group Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari. With 85 deaths, it is the deadliest massacre in the history of Italy as a Republic. There are over 109 different definitions of terrorism. [22] U. S. American political philosopher Michael Walzer in 2002 wrote: \"Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders\". [8] This meaning can be traced back to Sergey Nechayev, who described himself as a \"terrorist\". [23] Nechayev founded the Russian terrorist group \"People's Retribution\" (Народная расправа) in 1869. [24]In November 2004, a Secretary-General of the United Nations report described terrorism as any act \"intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act\". [25] Alternatively, responding to developments in modern warfare, Paul James and Jonathan Friedman distinguish between state terrorism against non-combatants and state terrorism against combatants, including ' Shock and Awe ' tactics:\"Shock and Awe\" as a subcategory of \"rapid dominance\" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel. [26]But defining terrorism has proven controversial. Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of terrorism in their national legislation. Moreover, the international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term \"terrorism\" is politically and emotionally charged. [27] [28] In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination. [29]These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism. [30] The international community has adopted a series of sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities. Since 1994, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism: Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them. [31]U. S. Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f (d) defines terrorism as: \"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience\". [32]Bruce Hoffman, an American scholar, has noted: It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, 'Political Terrorism: A Research Guide,' Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definitions of terrorism in an effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schmid was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the \"search for an adequate definition is still on\". Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt. [33]Hoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that: The Baghdad bus station was the scene of a triple car bombing in August 2005 that killed 43 people. By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is:ineluctably political in aims and motives;violent – or, equally important, threatens violence;designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders;andperpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity. [34]A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism: Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience (s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states. [35]Oslo, Norway immediately after the 2011 terrorist attack in Norway perpetrated by Anders Behring Breivik Each act of terrorism is a \"performance\" devised to affect many large audiences. Terrorists also attack national symbols, [36] to show power and to attempt to shake the foundation of the country or society they are opposed to. This may negatively affect a government, while increasing the prestige of the given terrorist group and/or ideology behind a terrorist act. [37]Terrorist acts frequently have a political purpose. [38] This is often where the inter-relationship between terrorism and religion occurs. When a political struggle is integrated into the framework of a religious or \"cosmic\" [39] struggle, such as over the control of an ancestral homeland or holy site such as Israel and Jerusalem, failing in the political goal (nationalism) becomes equated with spiritual failure, which, for the highly committed, is worse than their own death or the deaths of innocent civilians. [40]Their suffering accomplishes the terrorists' goals of instilling fear, getting their message out to an audience or otherwise satisfying the demands of their often radical religious and political agendas. [41]Some official, governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act. [42] [ better source needed] to distinguish between actions authorized by a government (and thus \"lawful\") and those of other actors, including individuals and small groups. For example, carrying out a strategic bombing on an enemy city, which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause, would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government. This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted, [ attribution needed] because: it denies the existence of state terrorism; [43] the same act may or may not be classed as terrorism depending on whether its sponsorship is traced to a \"legitimate\" government; \"legitimacy\" and \"lawfulness\" are subjective, depending on the perspective of one government or another; and it diverges from the historically accepted meaning and origin of the term. [44] [45] [46] [47]According to Ali Khan, the distinction lies ultimately in a political judgment. [48]An associated, and arguably more easily definable, but not equivalent term is violent non-state actor. [49] The semantic scope of this term includes not only \"terrorists\", but while excluding some individuals or groups who have previously been described as \"terrorists\", and also explicitly excludes state terrorism. U. S. president Barack Obama, commenting on the Boston Marathon bombings of April 2013, declared that \" [a]nytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror\". [50] Various commentators have pointed out the distinction between \"act of terror\" and \"terrorism\", particularly when used by the White House. [51] [52] 18 U. S. C. § 2331 defines \"international terrorism\" and \"domestic terrorism\" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled \"Terrorism\":\"International terrorism\" means activities with the following three characteristics: Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law; Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U. S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum. Pejorative use [ edit]See also: Controversies about Labeling Terrorism Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state-groups. [9] [10] [4] [11] [8]Those labeled \"terrorists\" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures. Jihadi, mujaheddin, and fedayeen are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon. It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists. [53]On whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, utilitarian philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the \"harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism\". [54] Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, Michael Walzer argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when \"a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so\". [54] [55]In his book Inside Terrorism Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term terrorism becomes distorted: On one point, at least, everyone agrees: terrorism is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view. Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label terrorist to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint.' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization terrorist becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism. [56] [57] [58]President Reagan meeting with Afghan Mujahideen leaders in the Oval Office in 1983The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism, \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\". [53] This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally. During World War II, the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army was allied with the British, but during the Malayan Emergency, members of its successor (the Malayan Races Liberation Army ), were branded \"terrorists\" by the British. [59] [60] More recently, Ronald Reagan and others in the American administration frequently called the mujaheddin \"freedom fighters\" during the Soviet–Afghan War [61] yet twenty years later, when a new generation of Afghan men were fighting against what they perceive to be a regime installed by foreign powers, their attacks were labelled \"terrorism\" by George W. Bush. [62] [63] [64] Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action. [65] [66] [67] Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner, director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa's Carleton University, defines \"terrorist acts\" as unlawful attacks for political or other ideological goals, and said: There is the famous statement: 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.' But that is grossly misleading. It assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act. One can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts, it is terrorism regardless. [68]Some groups, when involved in a \"liberation\" struggle, have been called \"terrorists\" by the Western governments or media. Later, these same persons, as leaders of the liberated nations, are called \"statesmen\" by similar organizations. Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela. [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74]Wiki Leaks editor Julian Assange has been called a \"terrorist\" by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. [75] [76]Sometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists. For instance, for many years, some branches of the United States government refused to label members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States' closest allies (the United Kingdom) that the UK branded as terrorism. This was highlighted by the Quinn v. Robinson case. [77] [78]Media outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of \"terrorist\" and \"terrorism\" because they are loosely defined, potentially controversial in nature, and subjective terms. [79] [80]See also: Violent non-state actor History [ edit]Main article: History of terrorism The Irish Republican Brotherhood was one of the earliest organizations to use modern terrorist tactics. Pictured, \"The Fenian Guy Fawkes \" by John Tenniel (1867). Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD. [81] Sicarii Zealots, though some dispute whether the group, a radical offshoot of the Zealots which was active in Judaea Province at the beginning of the 1st century AD, was in fact terrorist. According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian Josephus, after the Zealotry rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed, [82] [83] Judas of Galilee formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the Sicarii, in 6 AD. [84] Their terror was also directed against Jewish \"collaborators\", including temple priests, Sadducees, Herodians, and other wealthy elites. [85]The term \"terrorism\" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the Jacobin Club during the \" Reign of Terror \" in the French Revolution. \"Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible\", said Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre. In 1795, Edmund Burke denounced the Jacobins for letting \"thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists ... loose on the people\" of France. In January 1858, Italian patriot Felice Orsini threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor Napoleon III. [86] Eight bystanders were killed and 142 injured. [86] The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups. [86]Arguably the first organization to utilize modern terrorist techniques was the Irish Republican Brotherhood, [87] founded in 1858 as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group [88] that carried out attacks in England. [89] The group initiated the Fenian dynamite campaign in 1881, one of the first modern terror campaigns. [90] Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used modern, timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains. [91]Another early terrorist group was Narodnaya Volya, founded in Russia in 1878 as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by Sergei Nechayev and \" propaganda by the deed \" theorist Carlo Pisacane. [81] [92] [93] The group developed ideas—such as targeted killing of the 'leaders of oppression'—that were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of [94] —enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination. [95]Scholars of terrorism refer to four major waves of global terrorism: \"the Anarchist, the Anti-Colonial, the New Left, and the Religious. The first three have been completed and lasted around 40 years; the fourth is now in its third decade.\" [96]Infographics [ edit]See also: Number of terrorist incidents by country Terrorist incidents, 1970–2015.

Source: Europol. [97] [98] [99]Aftermath of the King David Hotel bombing by the Zionist militant group Irgun, July 1946A view of damage to the U. S. Embassy in the aftermath of the 1983 Beirut bombing caused by Islamic Jihad Organization and Hezbollah In early 1975, the Law Enforcement Assistant Administration in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled Disorders and Terrorism, produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H. H. A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff. The Task Force defines terrorism as \"a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes\". It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories: [100]Civil disorder – A form of collective violence interfering with the peace, security, and normal functioning of the community. Political terrorism – Violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes. Non-Political terrorism – Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits \"conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for coercive purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective\". Quasi-terrorism – The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient. It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction. [101] [102] [103] For example, the fleeing felon who takes hostages is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different. Limited political terrorism – Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a revolutionary approach; limited political terrorism refers to \"acts of terrorism which are committed for ideological or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the state \". Official or state terrorism – \"referring to nations whose rule is based upon fear and oppression that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions\". It may also be referred to as Structural Terrorism defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy. Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into domestic terrorism and international terrorism, or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism. [104] One way the typology of terrorism may be defined: [105] [106]Political terrorism Sub-state terrorism Social revolutionary terrorism Nationalist-separatist terrorism Religious extremist terrorism Religious fundamentalist Terrorism New religions terrorism Right-wing terrorism Left-wing terrorism State-sponsored terrorism Regime or state terrorism Criminal terrorism Pathological terrorism Motivations of terrorists [ edit]Attacks on 'collaborators' are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control. This strategy was used in Ireland, in Kenya, in Algeria and in Cyprus during their independence struggles. Attacks on high-profile symbolic targets are used to incite counter-terrorism by the state to polarize the population. [ clarification needed] [ citation needed] This strategy was used by Al-Qaeda in its attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States on September 11, 2001. These attacks are also used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported, such as the Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970 and the South Moluccan hostage crisis in the Netherlands in 1975. Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness. [107] Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined. [107] Additionally, Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism. [108] Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence. [109]Some terrorists like Timothy Mc Veigh were motivated by revenge against a state for its actions against its citizens. According to Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that Just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. Many were chronically unemployed and consistently struggled to hold any form of employment for a significant amount of time. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault. [110]It is true that one of the main reasons behind terrorism is a strong religious belief however there are other factors such as cultural, social and political. Even though these reasons are like most around the world. The drive behind these Chechen terrorists are quite distinct and unique from others. Many of the Chechens considered themselves secular freedom fighters, nationalist insurgents seeking to establish an independent secular state of Chechnya. A distinction must be made from the beginning between national Chechen terrorists and non-Chechen fighters who have adopted the idea from abroad. Few Chechen fighters fought for the jihads although on the other hand most of the non-Chechen fighters did (Janeczko, 2014 [111]One of the major reasons why terrorists are motivated and perhaps eager to carry out horrific acts is assurance of financial stability for their families, that they are given when they join a terrorist organization. An extra grant is provided for the families of suicide bombers. [22]Democracy and domestic terrorism [ edit]The neutrality of this section is disputed.

Please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced. (March 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)The relationship between domestic terrorism and democracy is very complex. Terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom, and it is least common in the most democratic nations. [112] [113] [114] [115] However, one study suggests that suicide attacks may be an exception to this general rule. [ irrelevant citation] Evidence regarding this particular method of terrorism reveals that every modern suicide campaign has targeted a democracy–a state with a considerable degree of political freedom. [116] [ relevant? – discuss] [ verify] The study suggests that concessions awarded to terrorists during the 1980s and 1990s for suicide attacks increased their frequency. [ example needed] [ dubious – discuss] [117] There is a connection between the existence of civil liberties, democratic participation and terrorism. [ improper synthesis?] According to Young and Dugan, these things encourage terrorist groups to organize and generate terror. [118] [ non sequitur]Some examples of \"terrorism\" in non-democratic nations include ETA in Spain under Francisco Franco (although the group's terrorist activities increased sharply after Franco's death), [119] the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in pre-war Poland, [120] the Shining Path in Peru under Alberto Fujimori, [121] the Kurdistan Workers Party when Turkey was ruled by military leaders [ citation needed] and the ANC in South Africa. [122] Democracies, such as Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, Indonesia, India, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Philippines, have also experienced domestic terrorism. While a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties. [123] For this reason, homegrown terrorism has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden. [124] This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist (s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system. [125]Religious terrorism [ edit]Main article: Religious terrorism Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. Some 35,000 Pakistanis have died from terrorist attacks in recent years. [126]Terrorist acts throughout history have been performed on religious grounds with the goal to either spread or enforce a system of belief, viewpoint or opinion. [127] [ dubious – discuss] [ irrelevant citation] The validity and scope of religious terrorism is limited to an individual's view or a group's view or interpretation of that belief system's teachings. [ citation needed] [ context? ]According to the Global Terrorism Index by the University of Maryland, College Park, religious extremism has overtaken national separatism and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world. Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks. The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda. Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organisations such as the IRA and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks. The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown. The prevalence of Islamist groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria is the main driver behind these trends. [128]Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are Boko Haram, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIL. These groups have been most active in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. 80% of all deaths from terrorism occurred in one of these five countries. [128]In 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report on terrorism in the United States. The report (titled The Age of the Wolf) found that during that period, \"more people have been killed in America by non-Islamic domestic terrorists than jihadists .\" [129] The \"virulent racist and anti-semitic\" ideology of the ultra-right wing Christian Identity movement is usually accompanied by anti-government sentiments. [130] Adherents of Christian Identity believe that whites of European descent can be traced back to the \" Lost Tribes of Israel \" and many consider Jews to be the Satanic offspring of Eve and the Serpent. [130] This group has committed hate crimes, bombings and other acts of terrorism. Its influence ranges from the Ku Klux Klan and neo-nazi groups to the anti-government militia and sovereign citizen movements. [130] Christian Identity 's origins can be traced back to Anglo-Israelism. Anglo-Israelism held the view that Jews were descendants of ancient Israelites who had never been lost. By the 1930s, the movement had been infected with anti-Semitism, and eventually Christian Identity theology diverged from traditional Anglo-Israelism, and developed what is known as the \"two seed\" theory. [130] According to the two-seed theory, the Jewish people are descended from Cain and the serpent (not from Shem ). [130] The white European seedline is descended from the \"lost tribes\" of Israel. They hold themselves to \"God's laws\", not to \"man's laws\", and they do not feel bound to a government that they consider run by Jews and the New World Order. [130]Dawabsheh family home after Duma arson attack Israel has also had problems with Jewish religious terrorism. Yigal Amir assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. For Amir, killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians. [131]Perpetrators [ edit]The perpetrators of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states. According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may also carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war. However, the most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive cells, highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the September 11 attacks, the London underground bombing, 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2002 Bali bombing were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks. These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient telecommunications to succeed where others had failed. [132]Over the years, much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances. [133] Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as violent non-state actors. [ citation needed] A 2007 study by economist Alan B. Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28% vs. 33%) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47% vs. 38%). Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families, vs. 30% of male Palestinians, and over 60% had gone beyond high school, vs. 15% of the populace. A study into the poverty-stricken conditions and whether or not,terrorists are more likely to come from here,show that people who grew up in these situations tend to show aggression and frustration towards others. This theory is largely debated for the simple fact that just because one is frustrated,does not make them a potential terrorist. [22] [134]To avoid detection, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave normally until executing the assigned mission. Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality, physical, or sociological traits are not useful. [135] The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person. [136] However, the majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men, aged 16–40. [136]Non-state groups [ edit]There is speculation that anthrax mailed inside letters to U. S. politicians was the work of a lone wolf. Main articles: List of designated terrorist groups, Lone wolf (terrorism), and Violent non-state actor Groups not part of the state apparatus of in opposition to the state are most commonly referred to as a \"terrorist\" in the media. State sponsors [ edit]Main article: State-sponsored terrorism A state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist group. Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state-sponsored terrorism vary widely. When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist, they rarely acknowledge them as such. [137] [ citation needed]State terrorism [ edit]Main article: State terrorism Civilization is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy. Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible, that is, unnoticed. When it is noticed, it is fully rationalized. Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable, and when it does occur it is regarded with shock, horror, and the fetishization of the victims.— Derrick Jensen [138]Infant crying in Shanghai's South Station after the Japanese bombing, 28 August 1937. As with \"terrorism\" the concept of \"state terrorism\" is controversial. [139] The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of 12 international Conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to State terrorism, which was not an international legal concept. If States abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law. [140] Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that it is \"time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law\". [141] However, he also made clear that, \"regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is that any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.\" [142]USS Arizona (BB-39) burning during the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German bombing of London, the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, the British and American firebombing of Dresden, and the U. S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. He argues that \"the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.\" He also cites the first strike option as an example of the \"terror of coercive diplomacy\" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in \"crisis management\" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction, and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state . [143] [144] [145]St Paul's Cathedral after the German bombing of London, c. 1940. Charles Stewart Parnell described William Ewart Gladstone 's Irish Coercion Act as terrorism in his \"no-Rent manifesto\" in 1881, during the Irish Land War. [146] The concept is also used to describe political repressions by governments against their own civilian populations with the purpose of inciting fear. For example, taking and executing civilian hostages or extrajudicial elimination campaigns are commonly considered \"terror\" or terrorism, for example during the Red Terror or the Great Terror. [147] Such actions are also often described as democide or genocide, which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism. [148] Empirical studies on this have found that democracies have little democide. [149] [150] Western democracies, including the United States, have supported state terrorism [151] and mass killings, [152] with some examples being the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966 and Operation Condor. [153] [154] [155]Connection with tourism [ edit]The connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the Luxor massacre in Egypt. [156] [157] In the 1970s, the targets of terrorists were politicians and chiefs of police while now, international tourists and visitors are selected as the main targets of attacks. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, were the symbolic epicenter, which marked a new epoch in the use of civil transport against the main power of the planet. [158] From this event onwards, the spaces of leisure that characterized the pride of West, were conceived as dangerous and frightful. [159] [160]. Funding [ edit]Main article: Terrorist financing State sponsors have constituted a major form of funding; for example, Palestine Liberation Organization, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations, were funded by the Soviet Union. [161] [162] The Stern Gang received funding from Italian Fascist officers in Beirut to undermine the British Mandate for Palestine. [163] Pakistan has created and nurtured terrorist groups as policy for achieving tactical objectives against its neighbours, especially India. [164]\" Revolutionary tax \" is another major form of funding, and essentially a euphemism for \" protection money \". [161] Revolutionary taxes \"play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population\". [161]Other major sources of funding include kidnapping for ransoms, smuggling (including wildlife smuggling ), [165] fraud, and robbery. [161] The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has reportedly received funding \"via private donations from the Gulf states \". [166]The Financial Action Task Force is an inter-governmental body whose mandate, since October 2001, has included combating terrorist financing. [167]Tactics [ edit]Main article: Tactics of terrorism The Wall Street bombing at noon on September 16, 1920 killed thirty-eight people and injured several hundred. The perpetrators were never caught. [168]Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity, usually using explosives or poison. [169] Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through organized crime. Communications occur through modern telecommunications, or through old-fashioned methods such as couriers. There is also concern about terrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction. Terrorism is a form of asymmetric warfare, and is more common when direct conventional warfare will not be effective because forces vary greatly in power. [170]The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political conflict. The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include: Secession of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state Dominance of territory or resources by various ethnic groups Imposition of a particular form of government Economic deprivation of a population Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army Religious fanaticism Responses [ edit]Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism Responses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the political spectrum and reassessments of fundamental values. Specific types of responses include: Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers Target hardening, such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers Preemptive or reactive military action Increased intelligence and surveillance activities Preemptive humanitarian activities More permissive interrogation and detention policies The term \" counter-terrorism \" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors. Response in the United States [ edit]See also: War on Terror X-ray backscatter technology ( AIT) machine used by the TSA to screen passengers. According to the TSA, this is what the remote TSA agent would see on their screen. According to a report by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin in The Washington Post, \"Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.\" [171]America's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought. Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home. [172] In the introduction of the U. S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, Sarah Sewall states the need for \"U. S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle.... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants––and erode support of the host nation.\" Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: \"Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted.... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction.\" [173] This strategy, often termed \"courageous restraint\", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield, yet it fails to address the central truth: the terrorists we face are mostly homegrown. [172]Terrorism research [ edit]Terrorism research, also called terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, and the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field. [174]Mass media [ edit]La Terroriste, a 1910 poster depicting a female member of the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party throwing a bomb at a Russian official's car. Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media. Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media. [175]The Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages. [176] This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource. [177]The mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism. However, this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely James F. Pastor explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other. [178]There is always a point at which the terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt. A point at which the violence may well escalate, but beyond which the terrorist has become symptomatic of the media gestalt itself. Terrorism as we ordinarily understand it is innately media-related.— Novelist William Gibson [179]Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also famously spoke of the close connection between terrorism and the media, calling publicity 'the oxygen of terrorism'. [180]Outcome of terrorist groups [ edit]How terrorist groups end (n = 268): The most common ending for a terrorist group is to convert to nonviolence via negotiations (43 percent), with most of the rest terminated by routine policing (40 percent). Groups that were ended by military force constituted only 7 percent. [181]Jones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006. They found 648. of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006. [182] Of the ones that ended, 43 percent converted to nonviolent political actions, like the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. Law enforcement took out 40 percent. Ten percent won. Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were taken out by military force. Forty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006. Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors. Only 5 percent were taken out by law enforcement. 26 percent won. 21 percent succumbed to military force. [183] Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists. To avoid that, the rules of engagement must be conscious of collateral damage and work to minimize it. Another researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end: [184]Capture or killing of a group's leader. (Decapitation). Entry of the group into a legitimate political process. (Negotiation). Achievement of group aims. (Success). Group implosion or loss of public support. (Failure). Defeat and elimination through brute force. (Repression). Transition from terrorism into other forms of violence. (Reorientation).

A sequel to the 1979 film Alien, Aliens follows Weaver's character Ellen Ripley as she returns to the planet where her crew encountered the hostile Alien creature, this time accompanied by a unit of Colonial Marines. Aliens' action-adventure tone was in contrast to the horror motifs of the original Alien. Following the success of The Terminator, which helped establish Cameron as a major action director, 20th Century Fox greenlit Aliens with a budget of approximately $18 million. It was filmed in England at Pinewood Studios and at a decommissioned power plant. Aliens grossed $86 million at the US box office during its 1986 theatrical release and $131 million worldwide. The movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including a Best Actress nomination for Sigourney Weaver. It won in the categories of Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects. It won eight Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actress for Weaver and Best Direction and Best Writing for Cameron.

Duffy, M. S., CVRTAbout the Eye and How It Works Diagram of the eye, viewed from the side. National Eye Institute To understand this diagram of the eye, try to picture it as being split in two, like an apple that's been cut in half. Imagine yourself looking into the eye from the cut side. The Cornea The cornea is a transparent dome-shaped tissue that forms the front part of your eye. It functions as a window and allows light to enter your eye. It also begins the process of focusing light rays that allow you to see words and images clearly. The cornea provides 65-75% of your eye's focusing power. The cornea does not contain any blood vessels, but instead contains many nerve endings that make it extremely sensitive. That is why a scratch or a loose eyelash is so painful. Jake Whalen: Living and Coping with Keratoconus Jake Whalen is a freelance copywriter who has struggled for most of his life with keratoconus. Keratoconus is a degenerative condition of the cornea, a transparent dome-shaped tissue that forms the front part of the eye. Keratoconus gradually causes the cornea to thin, bulge/protrude outward, and become cone-shaped. This creates an abnormal curvature of the eye that can cause blurred vision, glare problems, light sensitivity, and even extreme pain. Learn more about the basics of effective eye care, including: The difference between normal eye and vision changes and symptoms of vision problems The different types of eye care professionals Questions to ask when you see an eye care specialist. Check out our Getting Started Kit for more ideas to help you live well with low vision. Sign up with Vision Aware to receive free weekly email alerts for more helpful information and tips for everyday living with vision loss. Aqueous Humor Aqueous humor is a clear, watery fluid, contained in two chambers behind the cornea, that helps to bring nutrients to the eye tissues. It is produced by the ciliary body, a ring of tissue that sits behind the iris. As it circulates, the aqueous fluid flows to the front part of the eye, where it is drained by the trabecular meshwork, a sponge-like filtering system located where the cornea and iris meet. After draining through the trabecular meshwork, the aqueous fluid then passes through a small duct, called the canal of Schlemm, and is absorbed into the bloodstream. The health of your eye depends upon a continuous process of production, flow, and drainage of this aqueous fluid. Any interruption of this process can lead to problems with increased pressure inside the eye, such as glaucoma. The Sclera The sclera is a tough white outer coating of fibrous tissue that covers your entire eyeball (all the way around) except for the cornea. The muscles that move the eye are attached to the sclera. The name sclera comes from the Greek word \"skleros,\" which means \"hard. \"The Iris and the Pupil The iris is a ring-shaped membrane inside the eye that surrounds an opening in the center, called the pupil. The iris contains muscles that allow the pupil to become larger (open up or dilate) and smaller (close up or constrict). The iris regulates the amount of light that enters your eye by adjusting the size of the pupil opening. In bright light, the iris closes (or constricts) and makes the pupil opening smaller to restrict the amount of light that enters your eye. The iris in bright light In dim light, the iris opens (or dilates) and makes the pupil opening larger to increase the amount of light that enters your eye: The iris in dim light In addition, it is the iris that determines your eye color. People with brown eyes have heavily pigmented irises, while people with blue or lighter-colored eyes have irises with less pigment. The Lens The lens is composed of transparent, flexible tissue and is located directly behind the iris and the pupil. It is the second part of your eye, after the cornea, that helps to focus light and images on your retina. Because the lens is flexible and elastic, it can change its curved shape to focus on objects and people that are either nearby or at a distance. The lens provides 25-35% of your eye's focusing power. The ciliary muscles, which are part of the ciliary body, are attached to the lens and contract or release to change the lens shape and curvature. The lens becomes more rounded to focus on near objects (see Figure 1): Fig. 1: A more rounded lens can focus on near objects. The lens becomes more elongated (or stretched) to focus on objects that are far away (see Figure 2): Fig. 2: A more elongated/stretched lens can focus on far objects Over time, the lens loses some of its elasticity and therefore loses some of its ability to focus on near objects. This is called presbyopia and explains why people need reading glasses as they become older. The Choroid The choroid is a dark brown membrane that is rich with blood vessels, located between the sclera and the retina. It supplies blood and nutrients to the retina and nourishes all of the other structures within the eye. The Vitreous The vitreous is the jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the back part of the eye. Over time, the vitreous becomes more liquid and can detach from the back part of the eye, which can create floaters. If you notice new floaters or flashing lights, it is important to see your eye doctor, because a detached vitreous can cause a hole (a condition called a macular hole) to develop in the retina. The Retina and Optic Nerve The retina is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the inside surface of the eye, much like wallpaper. Cells in the retina convert incoming light into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses are carried by the optic nerve (which resembles your television cable) to the brain, which finally interprets them as visual images. The macula is the small sensitive area in the center of the retina that provides clear central vision. The fovea is located in the center of the macula and provides the sharpest detail vision. Some Facts about the Retina The retina is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the inside surface of the eye. The retina contains photoreceptor cells that convert (or process) incoming light into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses are carried by the optic nerve (which resembles your television cable) to the brain, which finally interprets them as visual images. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones, which are the light-processing cells responsible for peripheral (side) and central (straight-ahead) vision. Rods The specialized, highly light-sensitive retinal processing cells that are able to function in low light levels. They provide peripheral (or side) vision, are responsible for dark adaptation, and are most sensitive to movement/motion. They are less sensitive to color perception. A normal retina contains approximately 120-150 million rods, primarily in the peripheral, or outer, retina. Rods provide scotopic vision which refers to eyesight in low light conditions. Cones The specialized retinal processing cells that function in bright light levels and provide central (or straight-ahead) vision, along with sharp visual acuity, detail, and color vision. They require bright light to function and are not sensitive to lower light levels. A normal retina contains approximately 6-7 million cones, primarily in the macula, the small area in the center of the retina that provides clear central vision. Cones are the most concentrated in the fovea, which is located in the center of the macula and provides the sharpest detail vision. Cones provide photopic vision, which refers to eyesight in daylight conditions.

[2] In humans, the whole sclera is white, contrasting with the coloured iris, but in other mammals the visible part of the sclera matches the colour of the iris, so the white part does not normally show. In the development of the embryo, the sclera is derived from the neural crest. [3] In children, it is thinner and shows some of the underlying pigment, appearing slightly blue. In the elderly, fatty deposits on the sclera can make it appear slightly yellow. The human eye is relatively rare for having an iris that is small enough for its position to be plainly visible against the sclera. This makes it easier for one individual to infer where another individual is looking, and the cooperative eye hypothesis suggests this has evolved as a method of nonverbal communication.

It is continuous with the dura mater and the cornea, and maintains the shape of the globe, offering resistance to internal and external forces, and provides an attachment for the extraocular muscle insertions. The sclera is perforated by many nerves and vessels passing through the posterior scleral foramen, the hole that is formed by the optic nerve. At the optic disc the outer two-thirds of the sclera continues with the dura mater (outer coat of the brain) via the dural sheath of the optic nerve. The inner third joins with some choroidal tissue to form a plate ( lamina cribrosa) across the optic nerve with perforations through which the optic fibers ( fasciculi) pass. The thickness of the sclera varies from 1mm at the posterior pole to 0.3 mm just behind the rectus muscle insertions. The sclera\\'s blood vessels are mainly on the surface. Along with the vessels of the conjunctiva (which is a thin layer covering the sclera), those in the episclera render the inflamed eye bright red. [4]In many vertebrates, the sclera is reinforced with plates of cartilage or bone, together forming a circular structure called the sclerotic ring. In primitive fish, this ring consists of four plates, but the number is lower in many living ray-finned fishes, and much higher in lobe-finned fishes, various reptiles, and birds. The ring has disappeared in many groups, including living amphibians, some reptiles and fish, and all mammals. [5]The eyes of all non-human primates are dark with small, barely visible sclera. Histology [ edit]The collagen of the sclera is continuous with the cornea. From outer to innermost, the four layers of the sclera are:episclerastromalamina fuscaendothelium The sclera is opaque due to the irregularity of the Type I [6] collagen fibers, as opposed to the near-uniform thickness and parallel arrangement of the corneal collagen. Moreover, the cornea bears more mucopolysaccharide (a carbohydrate that has among its repeating units a nitrogenous sugar, hexosamine) to embed the fibrils. The cornea, unlike the sclera, has five layers. The middle, thickest layer is also called the stroma. The sclera, like the cornea, contains a basal endothelium, above which there is the lamina fusca, containing a high count of pigment cells. [4]Sometimes, very small gray-blue spots can appear on the sclera, a harmless condition called scleral melanocytosis. Function [ edit]Human eyes are somewhat distinctive in the animal kingdom in that the sclera is very plainly visible whenever the eye is open. This is not just due to the white color of the human sclera, which many other species share, but also to the fact that the human iris is relatively small and comprises a significantly smaller portion of the exposed eye surface compared to other animals. It is theorized that this adaptation evolved because of our social nature as the eye became a useful communication tool in addition to a sensory organ. It is believed that the conspicuous sclera of the human eye makes it easier for one individual to infer where another individual is looking, increasing the efficacy of this particular form of nonverbal communication. [7] Animal researchers have also found that, in the course of their domestication, dogs have also developed the ability to pick up visual cues from the eyes of humans. Dogs do not seem to use this form of communication with one another and only look for visual information from the eyes of humans. [8]Injury [ edit]Trauma [ edit]The bony area that makes up the human eye socket provides exceptional protection to the sclera. However, if the sclera is ruptured by a blunt force or is penetrated by a sharp object, the recovery of full former vision is usually rare. If pressure is applied slowly, the eye is actually very elastic. However, most ruptures involve objects moving at some velocity. The cushion of orbital fat protects the sclera from head-on blunt forces, but damage from oblique forces striking the eye from the side is not prevented by this cushion. Hemorrhaging and a dramatic drop in intraocular pressure are common, along with a reduction in visual perception to only broad hand movements and the presence or absence of light. However, low-velocity injury which does not puncture and penetrate the sclera requires only superficial treatment and the removal of the object. Sufficiently small objects which become embedded and which are subsequently left untreated may eventually become surrounded by a benign cyst, causing no other damage or discomfort. [9]Thermal trauma [ edit]The sclera is rarely damaged by brief exposure to heat: the eyelids provide exceptional protection, and the fact that the sclera is covered in layers of moist tissue means that these tissues are able to cause much of the offending heat to become dissipated as steam before the sclera itself is damaged. Even relatively low-temperature molten metals when splashed against an open eye have been shown to cause very little damage to the sclera, even while creating detailed casts of the surrounding eyelashes. Prolonged exposure, however— on the order of 30 seconds— at temperatures above 45 °C (113 °F) will begin to cause scarring, and above 55 °C (131 °F) will cause extreme changes in the sclera and surrounding tissue. Such long exposures even in industrial settings are virtually nonexistent. [9]Chemical injury [ edit]The sclera is highly resistant to injury from brief exposure to toxic chemicals. The reflexive production of tears at the onset of chemical exposure tends to quickly wash away such irritants, preventing further harm. Acids with a p H below 2.5 are the source of greatest acidic burn risk, with sulfuric acid, the kind present in car batteries and therefore commonly available, being among the most dangerous in this regard. However, acid burns, even severe ones, seldom result in loss of the eye. [9]Alkali burns, on the other hand, such as those resulting from exposure to ammonium hydroxide or ammonium chloride or other chemicals with a p H above 11.5, will cause cellular tissue in the sclera to saponify and should be considered medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment. [9]Clinical significance [ edit]Yellowing of the sclera is a visual symptom of jaundice. In very rare but severe cases of kidney failure and liver failure, the sclera may turn black. Notes [ edit]^ The word sclera ( / ˈ s k l ɛər ə / or / ˈ s k l ɪər ə /; both are common), plural sclerae ( / ˈ s k l ɛər i / or / ˈ s k l ɪər i /) or scleras, is from the Greek skleros, meaning hard.

Even relatively low-temperature molten metals when splashed against an open eye have been shown to cause very little damage to the sclera, even while creating detailed casts of the surrounding eyelashes. Prolonged exposure, however— on the order of 30 seconds— at temperatures above 45 °C (113 °F) will begin to cause scarring, and above 55 °C (131 °F) will cause extreme changes in the sclera and surrounding tissue. Such long exposures even in industrial settings are virtually nonexistent. [9]Chemical injury [ edit]The sclera is highly resistant to injury from brief exposure to toxic chemicals. The reflexive production of tears at the onset of chemical exposure tends to quickly wash away such irritants, preventing further harm. Acids with a p H below 2.5 are the source of greatest acidic burn risk, with sulfuric acid, the kind present in car batteries and therefore commonly available, being among the most dangerous in this regard. However, acid burns, even severe ones, seldom result in loss of the eye. [9]Alkali burns, on the other hand, such as those resulting from exposure to ammonium hydroxide or ammonium chloride or other chemicals with a p H above 11.5, will cause cellular tissue in the sclera to saponify and should be considered medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment. [9]Clinical significance [ edit]Yellowing of the sclera is a visual symptom of jaundice. In very rare but severe cases of kidney failure and liver failure, the sclera may turn black. Notes [ edit]^ The word sclera ( / ˈ s k l ɛər ə / or / ˈ s k l ɪər ə /; both are common), plural sclerae ( / ˈ s k l ɛər i / or / ˈ s k l ɪər i /) or scleras, is from the Greek skleros, meaning hard.
